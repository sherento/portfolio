      Hi, I'm Sheren :) I'm an aspired front-end web developer.</br>
      </br>
      I've just finished studying full stack web development with GA.</br>
      And very much enjoyed the change and fast-paced learning of both front-end and back-end applications.</br>
      I am ready for new challenges and opportunities to keep learning.</br>
      I can't wait to put my new skills to play!</br>
      </br>
      I was a scientist in my past life. </br>
      I learned some valuable skills but something was missing and lacked a bit of spark..</br>
      </br>
      I then embraced my curiousity of how this all works..so here I am.. </br>
      </br>
      And very excited about creating the magic of possibilities..</br>
