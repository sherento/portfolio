        I'm Sheren, an aspired front-end web developer.</br>
        </br>
        I've just finished studying full stack web development with GA.</br>
        And very much enjoyed the change and fast-paced learning of both front-end and back-end applications.</br>
        I am ready for new challenges and opportunities to keep learning.</br>
        I can't wait to put my new skills to play!</br>
        </br>
        I was a scientist in my past life. </br>
        I learned some valuable skills but something was missing and lacked a bit of spark..</br>
        </br>
        I then embraced my curiousity of how this all works..so here I am.. </br>
        </br>
        And very excited about creating the magic of possibilities..</br>

        Heimat is a German for a place that makes us who we are.
        This was built using Ruby on Rails with the models of user, follow and comment/posts.
        There are still improvements to be implemented.

        Our group project was based on retro games which we named Gehms. Our games included Ping (Pong), Snaak (snake) and Roids (space shooter). We delegated our work into four parts. One team member made controllers and the other three members one game each. I contributed with building Roids. Roids was built using Rails, JavaScript, CSS and Phaser.js.
        Please visit and try our game: <a href="https://gehms.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">https://gehms.herokuapp.com</a>

        Augmented reality. The mobile phone camera (no iOS) or webcam, using the url: <a href="https://sherento.github.io/project3/" target="_blank">https://sherento.github.io/project3/</a> can detect the markers, in this case A, B and C. Animation of three dimensional shapes are seen when camera detects marker assigned. JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Three.js and AR.js libraries were used to implement marker augmented reality.
